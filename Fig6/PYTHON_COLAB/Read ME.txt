In the 'TEST_IDC_W_BLOCKAGE' folder,




## In the 'CODE_all' file,

   The first half is LSTM and testing. (All path predictions are done in a parallel way)

   The rest half is for Regression and testing.


## 'Position_Data_test_var_0_03_test_01' and 'REG_POS_IDC_W_var_0_03_test_01' mat files
    were generated from MATLAB and uploaded manually via saving
