1). There are 8 paths. (# of CU path = 4 and # of EU path = 4).

2). Actual path and predicted path positions can be found in the Data Sets folder.

3). Fig4.m file is used to plot the actual and predicted paths.

4). Actual path positions are generated using the Python file called clothoid_model.

5). Predicted paths are generated using the Python file called CODE_all.

3). There is a high step resolution in the path prediction and hence, for one path position vector can be considered after 10-20 steps
rather than, step by step if necessary.

4). When plotting one step is selected after 20 steps to avoid clutter in plots.
